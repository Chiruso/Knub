# Introduction

Knub is a modern TypeScript framework for creating Discord bots,
with a focus on great developer experience and safe defaults.

The primary goals for Knub are:
* **Safety first** â€” Knub aims to make it easy to write safe code by default
* **Predictability** â€” Any "magic" within Knub should be easy to reason about, and ideally the magic is left out in the first place
* **Automatic context-awareness** â€” Guild plugins only have access to the context of the guild (server) they're loaded in by default
* **Extensive built-in functionality** â€” For common bot requirements

These docs are still a work in progress.
