# Docs

The docs are built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Development

### Quick-start

1. Install packages
   ```
   $ npm ci
   ```
2. Run development server
   ```
   $ npm start
   ```
   This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory.

Unless you plan on hosting the docs yourself, you don't have to run this command manually.
The Cloudflare pages deployment does that automatically.
